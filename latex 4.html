	<h1>Math</h1>
	<p>There are two major modes of typesetting math in LaTeX one is embedding the math directly into your text by encapsulating your formula in dollar signs and the other is using a predefined math environment.</p>
<h2>Inline Math</h2>
		<p>To make use of the inline math feature, simply write your text and if you need to typeset a single math symbol or formula, surround it with dollar signs:</p>

		<h3>The equation and align environment</h3>
		<p>The most useful math envorinments are the equation environment for typesetting single equationsand the align environment for multiple equations and automatic alignment:</p>

		<p>The align environment will align the equations at the ampersand &. Single equations have to be seperated by a linebreak \\. There is no alignment when using the simple equation environment. Furthermore it is not even possible to enter two equations in that environment, it will result in a compilation error. The asterisk (e.g. equation*) only indicates, that I don't want the equations to be numbered.</p>
		<h3>Fractions and more</h3>
		<p>LaTeX is capable of displaying any mathematical notation. It's possible to typeset integrals, fractions and more. Every command has a specific syntax to use. I will demonstrate some of the most common LaTeX math features:</p>

		<h3>Matrices</h3>
		<p>Furthermore it's possible to display matrices in LaTeX. There is a special matrix environment for this purpose, please keep in mind that the matrices only work within math environments as described above:</p>

		<p>Since this matrix is without brackets.So if you want brackets then you have to change your code give as:</p>

		<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
		<ul><li>LaTeX is a powerful tool to typeset math</li>
		<li>Embed formulas in your text by surrounding them with dollar signs $</li>
		<li>The equation environment is used to typeset one formula</li>
		<li>The align environment will align formulas at the ampersand & symbol</li>
		<li>Single formulas must be seperated with two backslashes \\</li>
		<li>Use the matrix environment to typeset matrices</li>
		<li>Scale parentheses with \left( \right) automatically</li>
		<li>All mathematical expressions have a unique command with unique syntax</li>
		<li>Notable examples are:</li>
			<li>\int^a_b for integral symbol</li>
			<li>\frac{u}{v} for fractions</li>
			<li>\sqrt{x} for square roots</li></ul>
