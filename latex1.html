<h1>First Document</h1>
		<p>Creating documents with LaTeX is simple. In contrast to Word, you start off with a plain text file (.tex file) which contains LaTeX code and the actual content (i.e. text). LaTeX uses control statements, which define how your content should be formatted. Before you can see what the final result looks like, the LaTeX compiler will take your .tex file and compile it into a .pdf file. A basic example document can be created with the following code:</p>
		<center><img src="image1.png"></center>
		<p>Once you translated this code into a PDF document, you will find the text:

		Hello World!</p>
		<h2>Title Page</h2>
		<p>Look out on this example:</p>
		<center><img src="image2.png"></center>
		<p>Obviously the statements \title, \date and \author are not within the the document environment, so they will not directly show up in our document. The area before our main document is called preamble. In this specific example we use it to set up the values for the \maketitle command for later use in our document. This command will automatically create a titlepage for us. The \newpage command speaks for itself.</p>
		<p>Also there is page numbering due to \<u>pagenumbering</u> command.But if we don't want to have that page number showing up there. We can remove it, by telling LaTeX to hide the page number for our first page. This can be done by adding the \pagenumbering{gobble} command and then changing it back to \pagenumbering{arabic} on the next page numbers like so</p>
		<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
		<ul><li>A document has a preamble and document part</li>
			<li>The document environment must be defined</li>
			<li>Commands beginning with a backslash \, environments have a begin and end tag</li></ul>
