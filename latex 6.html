<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>In this session we're going to learn how to use the table and tabular environments to create tables in LaTeX.</p>
<h2>First Table</h2>
<p>Tables in LaTeX can be created through a combination of the table environment and the tabular environment. The table environment part contains the caption and defines the float for our table, i.e. where in our document the table should be positioned and whether we want it to be displayed centered. The \caption and \label commands can be used in the same way as for pictures. The actual content of the table is contained within the tabular environment.</p>
<p>The tabular environment uses ampersands & as column seperators and newline symbols \\ as row seperators. The vertical lines separating the columns of our table (|) are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g.\begin{tabular}{l|c|r} ) and the letters tell whether we want to align the content to the left (l), to the center (c) or to the right (r) for each column. There should be one letter for every column and a vertical line in between them or in front of them, if we want a vertical line to be shown in the table. Row seperators can be added with the \hline command.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at some actual code for a basic table, which you can easily copy-and-paste into your document and modify it to your needs.</p>

<h2>Align Numbers at Decimal Points</h2>
<p>The first thing we have to do is to include the siunitx package in our preamble and use the command \sisetup to tell the package how many digital places it should display:</p>
<center><img src="image18.png"></center>
<p>Afterwards we can use a new alignment setting in our tables, so besides left (l), center (c) and right (r), there's now an additional setting S, which will align the numbers automatically. In our previous table, there was an alignment problem with the middle column, so I've now changed the alignment setting of the middle column from (c) to (S):</p>

<h2>Adding Rows and Columns</h2>
<p>Now that we've setup our table properly, we can focus on adding more rows and columns. As I've mentioned before, LaTeX uses column separators (&) and row separators (\\) to layout the cells of our table.For the 5x3 table shown above we can count five times (\\) behind each row and two times (&) per row, separating the content of three columns.</p>
<p>If we now want to add an additional row,i will be reusing the table from above for this example and add an additional row by putting (\\) at end of last row:</p>
<center><img src="image20.png"></center>
<p>Adding an additional column is also possible, but you have to be careful, because you have to add a column separator (&) to every column:</p>
<center><img src="image21.png"></center>
<h3>Using Multirow</h3>
<p>In order for a cell to span multiple rows, we have to use the multirow command. This command accepts three parameters:</p>
<center><img src="image22.png"></center>
<p>I usually use an asterisk (*) as a parameter for the width, since this basically means, that the width should be determined automatically.Because we're combining two rows in our example, it's necessary to omit the content of the same row in the following line. Let's look at how the actual LaTeX code would look like:</p>
<center><img src="image23.png"></center>
<h3>Using Multicolumn</h3>
<p>If we want a cell to span multiple columns, we have to use the multicolumn command. The usage differs a bit from multirow command, since we also have to specifiy the alignment for our column. The command also requires three parameters:</p>
<center><img src="image24.png"></center>
<p>In our example, we will again combine two neighboring cells, note that in the row where we're using multicolumn to span two columns, there's only one column separator (&) (instead of two for all other rows):</p>
<center><img src="image25.png"></center>
<h3>Combining Multirow and Multicolumn</h3>
<p>Of course it's also possible to combine the two features, to make a cell spanning multiple rows and columns. To do this, we simply use the multicolumn command and instead of specifying content, we add a multirow command as the content. We then have to add another multicolumn statement for as many rows as we're combining.</p>
<p>Because this is a little hard to explain, it will be much clearer when looking at the code. In this example, we're going to combine two columns and two rows, so we're getting a cell spanning a total of four cells:</p>

<h3>Prettier tables with booktabs</h3>
<p>Of course beauty is always in the eye of the beholder, but I personally think, that the default hlines used by the table environment are not very pretty. For my tables, i always use the booktabs package, which provides much prettier horizontal separators and the usage is not harder compared to simply using hlines.Again, we have to add the according booktabs package to our preamble:</p>
<center><img src="image27.png"></center>
<p>We can now replace the hlines in our example table with toprule, midrule and bottomrule provided by the booktabs package:</p>
<center><img src="image28.png"></center>
<h3>Multipage Table</h3>
<p>If you have a lot of rows in your table, you will notice that by default, the table will be cropped at the bottom of the page, which is certainly not what you want. The package longtable provides a convenient way, to make tables span multiple pages. Of course we have to add the package to our preamble before we can start using it:</p>
<center><img src="image29.png"></center>
<p>It's actually not harder, but easier to use than the previous code for tables. I will first show you what the code looks like and than explain the differences between longtable and tabular, in case they're not obvious.</p>
<center><img src="image30.png"></center>
<p>In the previous examples, we've always used the table and tabular environments. The longtable environment replaces both of them or rather combines both of them into a single environment. We now use \begin{longtable}[POSITION_ON_PAGE]{ALIGNMENT} as an environment for our tables. Using this environment, we create a table, that is automatically split between pages, if it has too many rows.The content on the table on the first page looks like this:</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<ul>
    <li>LaTeX offers the table and tabular environment for table creation</li></ul>
    <li>The table environment acts like a wrapper for the tabular similar to the figure environment</li>
    <li>Alignment and vertical separators are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g. \begin{tabular}{l|c||r})</li>
    <li>It's possible to align the content left (l), centered (c) and right (r), where the number of alignment operators has to match the desired number of columns</li>
    <li>The columns can be seperated by adding | in between the alignment operators</li>
    <li>Rows can be seperated using the \hline command and columns using the ampersand & symbol</li>
    <li>The newline \\ operator indicates the end of a row</li>
    <li>It's possible to refer to tables using \ref and \label</li>
    <li>Align numbers at the decimal point using the siunitx package</li>
    <li>Combine multiple rows and columns with the multirow package</li>
